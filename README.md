## Description:

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg "License Badge")
This application is a portfolio used to demonstrate my current skill set as a full stack developer using React as the written language. When you start the application, you will find a home section that will lead to multiple pages that will either list my skill set, my resume, information about myself and a useable form if I needed to be contacted.

## Sections:

There are currently 5 sections available on my page in which a user can access. To begin with, we have the home which consists of a basic display with a nav bar and footer with ways to connect to my social media. From the navbar you can then continue on by clicking About me to find out information about myself including a photo of me and my logo that I also created. Next you can tap on the Resume button. You will then be lead to my skill sets and a link to download a pdf version of my resume. With that out of the way, you then can click on my works to gain access to the works that I've worked on so far from the different sets of languages I've used. Last but not least, the user will then be able to access a form that will be able to get into contact with me via email.
